# B-Tree
CONCEPT
In computer science, a B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that keeps sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. The B-tree generalizes the binary search tree, allowing for nodes with more than two children. Unlike other self-balancing binary search trees, the B-tree is well suited for storage systems that read and write relatively large blocks of data, such as discs. It is commonly used in databases and file systems.

GOAL
Implement the B Tree, as well as its data insertion, removal, search and printing operations to solve the problem purposed in class.

PROBLEM
The program must be built to process purchases, using B trees to record and process those purchases.
